## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

I started by building the layout and basic styling. Sass was the way to go.
For the rest of the project, I went with React. Although it wasn´t the greatest tool for this project, for the size of it I mean, I wanted to continue building things with it, cause the truth is, I love it.
Used firebase for hosting.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Some CSS! It´s great to learn new stylings.

### Continued development

Im planning the next frontend mentor project. The TODO List. Also with React.
I´ll let you know my outcome.
